# ConfigPane
My implementation of a laboratory exercise for the Human Computer Interaction course, which involved the refactoring of a simple ConfigPane class.

I have included two versions of my implementation:
- main_tabwidget uses the same structure as the original example, with a tab for the settings and another one for showing the buttons
- main_singlewindows merges the two tabs into a single one, effectively showing how the buttons change after the text has been edited
